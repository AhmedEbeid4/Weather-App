I had used Rest API which called openweathermap to get the weather data.

the application gets the location of the user while looping in the spalsh screen, Then getting the weather data of his location via The API using ION package, and by getting some data from Json Arrays and Objects from the API.

And I had used sqlite database to store user's location when he enters the App without opening the GPS Because if the user enters the application without opening the GPS, The App will show weather data in the last place he went to.

The API provides to us the temperature in Kelvin degree, I had written a function that changes the Kevin degree to Celsius degree.





I had used location , internet permissions.


In Home Activity shows the current weather data of the user's location.


In Forecast Report Activity shows the weekly weather data of user's location.



In Search Activity The user can search about any city and it will show to him the current weather of this city and weekly weather data if the city that the user is searching about doesn't exist in the API it will make a message for him.



If No Internet Access it will show it to the user 'Without Using Services'.



If you had downloded the project you have to get an API key from openweathermap API to run the project beacuse I had made my API key secure.
